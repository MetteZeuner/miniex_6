<h3>My program<h3>
<h6> My program is very simple and hopefully demonstrates the concept of generative art correctly. The program adds circles to a random place which makes the outcome different everytime you run the program. I've applied 3 basic rules - rule 1 makes the circles a different size, rule 2 makes the circles change colour between white and black, rule 3 makes a line connect to circles that are smaller than 14. I wanted to add a fourth rule that changed the lines to a different colour everytime another line was added, but i couldn't get it to work. Since the random placement of the circles depends on the program it becomes hard to predict the outcomes since you are not in control of where the circles are to be placed.The outcome could therefore be seen as a nonhuman creation. <h6
